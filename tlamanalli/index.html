        <p>Welcome to the website for The Tlamanalli Initiative, an initiative started by <a href="cipactlan.org">CIPACTLAN</a>.</p>
        
        <h1>The Initiative</h1>
        <p>We are a collective of professionals and academics working together to combat climate change through collaborative and coordinated effort through different disciplines such as computer science, engineering, farm work, construction, architecture, and waste management.
        
        <h1>Our Tlamanalli</h1>
        <p>With the looming threat of climate change ever present, we as a society need to respond accordingly with our tlamanalli- our offerings and sacrifices- through our sacrifice of time, our sacrifice of energy, and our sacrifice of resources to ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.</p>
        <p>Our offerings and sacrifices come from a sense of reverence and respect for the natural world which provides for us and, rather than believing we have dominion over the it, we believe we have a responsibility to protect it.</p>
        
        <h1>EDUCATE: Building a foundation</h1>
        <p>Those involved in the initiative will be educated in Indigenous culture to help understand the core principles that drive us. With the core material understood, members will begin working with others within the initiative and guide youth towards their academic and professional goals.</p>
        
        <h1>AID: Para todos, todo. Para nosotros, nada.</h1>
        <p>Members are required to donate time, energy, and resources towards helping others within their community for no cost. This can come in many forms such as doctors providing medical care, an IT specialist helping improve infrastructure, and farms providing viable food that wouldn't normally sell. We believe that through collective efforts we can uplift not just ourselves, but others around us as well.</p>
        
        <h1>INNOVATE</h1>
        <p>Members of the initiative are also expected to work with others in a team to research and develop new technologies, policies, and procedures to revolutionize slow-moving or stagnant industries to combat climate change and act as a competition for industries refusing to change and adapt.</p>
